👋 Hi, I’m a beginner programmer and an over‑caffeinated bookworm.📖 
That means my life is basically split between two worlds:
1️⃣ In one, I’m lost in gripping thrillers filled with mysterious murders,
mouth‑watering culinary tales that make me hungry while I code, and 
love stories so dramatic they could crash my program faster than a 
missing comma.
2️⃣ In the other, I’m staring at my screen wondering why my code keeps 
throwing errors that sound suspiciously like a bad book reviews.🤔

This project is my attempt to merge those worlds — a digital library 
built by someone who still thinks “syntax error” is just the computer 
being dramatic. And also an attempt to stop circling around between 
the 3 floors of my house looking for something like a broken for cycle.
This project doesn’t just organize books — oh no, it also tries to 
calculate the potential profit from selling them. Because apparently, 
my inner bookworm decided to moonlight as a business analyst.

Here’s how it works:

📘Input: A list of books and their prices.

🪄Process: A bunch of math that looks suspiciously like a magic spell.

💸Output: A number that tells you how much money you could make… assuming 
people actually buy your books and not just borrow them forever.

 In short, this project is where my bookworm heart meets my 
beginner‑programmer brain. It may crash, it may loop endlessly, 
but like any good story, it’s worth turning the page to see what 
happens next.
